  <font color="black" size="5"><b>DESCRIPTION:</b> "stand-alone senior high school" refers to a senior high school (Grades 11 and 12) that is physically separate from a junior high school or integrated school, with its own designated location and separate administration, including a distinct school head. In essence, it's a senior high school operating independently, not as part of a larger, combined educational institution. </font><br><br>
